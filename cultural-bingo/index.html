					Tarsem's "The Fall" is a mad folly, an extravagant visual orgy, a free-fall from reality into uncharted realms. Surely it is one of the wildest indulgences a director has ever granted himself. Tarsem, for two decades a leading director of music videos and TV commercials, spent millions of his own money to finance "The Fall," filmed it for four years in 28 countries and has made a movie that you might want to see for no other reason than because it exists. There will never be another like it.
					<br/>
					"The Fall" is so audacious that when Variety calls it a "vanity project," you can only admire the man vain enough to make it. It tells a simple story with vast romantic images so stunning I had to check twice, three times, to be sure the film actually claims to have absolutely no computer-generated imagery. None? What about the Labyrinth of Despair, with no exit? The intersecting walls of zig-zagging staircases? The man who emerges from the burning tree? Perhaps the key words are "computer-generated." Perhaps some of the images are created by more traditional kinds of special effects.

				<p class="excerpt">
				In the year 2015, the world stands on the brink of destruction. Humanity's last hope lies in the hands of Nerv, a special agency under the United Nations, and their Evangelions, giant machines capable of defeating the Angels who herald Earth's ruin. Gendou Ikari, head of the organization, seeks compatible pilots who can synchronize with the Evangelions and realize their true potential. Aiding in this defensive endeavor are talented personnel Misato Katsuragi, Head of Tactical Operations, and Ritsuko Akagi, Chief Scientist.
				<br/>
				<br/>

				Face to face with his father for the first time in years, 14-year-old Shinji Ikari's average life is irreversibly changed when he is whisked away into the depths of Nerv, and into a harrowing new destiny he must become the pilot of Evangelion Unit-01 with the fate of mankind on his shoulders.
				<br/>
				<br/>

				Written by Hideaki Anno, Neon Genesis Evangelion is a heroic tale of a young boy who will become a legend. But as this psychological drama unfolds, ancient secrets beneath the big picture begin to bubble to the surface...

					Fixed horse races. Cursed sapphires. A whole lot of Irish whiskey. If the ingredients of Peaky Blinders sound like they came straight out of the Gritty Period Drama Cookbook, that&#x2019;s because they did. But that doesn&#x2019;t mean you shouldn&#x2019;t watch. Sure, this BBC show smells like &#x201C;Boardwalk Empire from Over There,&#x201D; but it tastes just as good as&#x2014;if not better than&#x2014;the pulpy gangster series that came before it.
					Set in the 1910s and &#x2019;20s, Peaky Blinders traces its eponymous Birmingham, England street gang from ragtag to big time while also following the evolution (and/or devolution) of the Shelby family that runs it: Tommy (played by Cillian Murphy), the moody, merciless head of the family; Arthur (Paul Anderson), the unhinged older brother with a cocaine habit and the worst undercut outside of Williamsburg; Ada (Sophie Rundle), their sister who falls in love with a communist on the run; and Aunt Polly, the matriarch of the family, magnificently played by Helen McCrory.
